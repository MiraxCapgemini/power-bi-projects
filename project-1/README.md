# My First PowerBI Project

This project was completed as part of training on the Udemy course: 'Microsoft PowerBI: A Practical Guide'.

The project consisted on importing real Global cenus data and was used to create basic report views on global population trends and forecasts from 2010-2040. 
Elements of the projects include:
- Manipulation and preparation of data by loading & transforming it within the Power Query Editor
- Working with Data in the Data Model
- Establishing relationships between relational tables (i.e., DIM & FACT tables)
- Introduction to M-Language and DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
- Creating visuals in the Report View (including line, column, clustered column, tree tables, and splicers)
